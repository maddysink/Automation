# Reflection
This was definitely a challenge to complete, but I am very proud of myself. I had to rework my prompts multiple times before successfully setting up my automation, but after consulting with Gemini and adjusting the code myself, I was able to debug and successfully run the program.  I recieved very nice, day brightening emails thanks to this wonderful automation. I did not know this was a possible application for AI and I am really glad I learned how to do this.
